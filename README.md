Here's a draft for your README file, summarizing the content of your uploaded Jupyter notebooks:

Machine Learning and Deep Learning Notebooks
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks exploring various machine learning and deep learning concepts, primarily using PyTorch and scikit-learn.

Notebooks
1. Computer_vision_CNN.ipynb
This notebook focuses on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks. It likely covers:

Building and training CNN models.

Applying CNNs to image classification or other computer vision problems.

Demonstrations of CNN architectures and their implementation.

2. Mnist.ipynb
This notebook is dedicated to working with the MNIST dataset, a classic benchmark for image classification. It includes:

Loading and preparing the MNIST dataset.

Implementing and training a model (likely a neural network) to classify handwritten digits.

Evaluating the model's performance on the MNIST dataset.

3. Non linear dataset.ipynb
This notebook explores machine learning models designed for non-linear datasets. Key aspects include:

Generating non-linear datasets (e.g., using make_circles from scikit-learn).

Visualizing non-linear data distributions.

Developing and evaluating models capable of classifying or regressing on non-linear patterns.

The notebook uses sklearn and matplotlib to create and visualize data.

4. pytorch Model Practice.ipynb
This notebook serves as a general practice ground for fundamental PyTorch model concepts. It covers essential elements of building and training models in PyTorch, such as:

Defining neural network architectures using torch.nn.

Creating datasets and data loaders.

Implementing training loops.

Saving and loading trained models.

It demonstrates basic linear regression setup with known parameters, data creation, and train/test splitting.

Installation and Setup
To run these notebooks, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter installed, along with the necessary libraries.

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required libraries:
While a requirements.txt is not provided, based on the notebooks, you will likely need:

Bash

pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn matplotlib pandas
For Google Colab specific functionalities, no local installation is needed as it's a cloud-based environment.

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

Bash

jupyter notebook
This will open a browser window where you can navigate to and open the .ipynb files.

Usage
Each notebook is designed to be run independently. Open them in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and execute the cells sequentially to understand the concepts and see the models in action.
